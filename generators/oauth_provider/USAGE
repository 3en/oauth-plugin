./script/generate oauth_provider 

This creates an OAuth Provider controller as well as the requisite models.

It requires an authentication framework such as acts_as_authenticated, restful_authentication or restful_open_id_authentication.

If you generated the migration file (true by default), make sure you run
rake db:migrate

include the following in your user.rb

has_many :client_applications
has_many :tokens, :class_name=>"OauthToken",:order=>"authorized_at desc",:include=>[:client_application]
